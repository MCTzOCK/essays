		\item Their son experiences racism because of his skin color.
		\item The protocol was changed so that the son of Harry and Meghan would never get the title of Prince.

	This extract draws parallels between Harry's situation and that of Princess Madeleine of Sweden, who also negotiated a non-traditional royal arrangement, living in America and working for a non-profit while retaining her title.
	It also compares Harry and Meghan to Princess Diana, suggesting that like her, they would have overshadowed other royals due to their popularity and charisma.
	The article hints at a shift in public sentiment towards the monarchy, potentially leaning towards republicanism.
	 It concludes by suggesting that while Harry and Meghan may have found a new beginning in global philanthropy, the British royal family's prospects for a happy new beginning seem remote.
